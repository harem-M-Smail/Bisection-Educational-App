the bisection method is indeed used in engineering analysis, 
particularly in numerical methods for solving equations. 
It's a root-finding algorithm that iteratively narrows down the interval in which a root of a continuous function lies.
Engineers often encounter equations that cannot be solved analytically,
so numerical methods like the bisection method provide a means to approximate solutions,
which can be crucial for designing and analyzing systems and structures.
